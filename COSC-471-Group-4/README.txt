For our USER table, I found out that 'USER' is a keyword in 
mysql. I changed my USER table to 'USERR',
or, in hindsight, perhaps a better name would be 'USERS'.
Just a heads up.

Currently, the project works on my machine.
We can place orders, add to/remove from cart (which removes the item from the tables entirely),
orders print out for the admin, makeorder.php correctly deletes from tables and adds to orders table.
please test on own machine if possible.  I think we did it guys!
